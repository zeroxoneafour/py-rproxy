# py-rproxy

A very, _very_ simple Python caching reverse proxy.

Usage - `python main.py`  
`config.txt` contains config and is pretty self-explanatory

This is the `gateway` "legacy" branch. Instead of just fetching URLs on request, it caches them locally. It never really worked, so now it's a seperate branch.
