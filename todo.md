# things that are working
* concurrency - at least on my machine
* website dependency fetching

# things that are not working
* logging into websites (probably because of post)
* not filling the gateway with junk html we don't need

# things I want to work
* POST requests
* changing `/` to `https://<domain>/` for websites that are weird and use that
